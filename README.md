# python_db2_cli_lib

A small python library of methods and classes you can use
to execute db2 queries and commands via the db2/db2pd cli interface.

This is useful if you need a quick way (no drivers needed)
to implement monitoring ant automation for a db2 database
but you can't or do not have the time to install the python
driver library or some information is only available to you 
from the db2 cli interface.
